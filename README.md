## **Context:**
[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) is a Java framework designed for building modern, interactive web applications with a focus on a server-centric architecture. It simplifies UI development by offering a wide range of pre-built components, allowing developers to create dynamic interfaces without extensive knowledge of client-side technologies. With features like automatic server-client communication and data binding, Vaadin enhances productivity, making it an efficient tool for Java developers to create visually appealing web applications.

[Digital Memorial](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jis/article/view/2567)  is an online platform dedicated to preserving and sharing memories, tributes, and information about individuals, events, or specific themes. Serving as a virtual space for reminiscence, a digital memorial can encompass a variety of media, such as photos, videos, testimonials, and documents, providing a multifaceted representation of the person or subject at hand. These platforms offer an interactive means for individuals to contribute their own memories, fostering meaningful and participatory connections in a digital environment designed to honor and preserve history.

[Collective Digital Memorial](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jis/article/view/2567) When, in a digital memorial, the honored deceased people share a common bond. They can still be either a dedicated or an integrated memorial system. For example, the Memorial for the Coronavirus Victims in Brazil is a collective digital memorial integrated with the social network Facebook, and relíquia.rum is integrated with Instagram. On the other hand, “Inumeráveis” is a dedicated collective digital memorial, as it is presented on a website dedicated to the memorial.


## **Objectives:**
Testing Vaadin's capability to support a collective digital memorial application. The aim of this project is to thoroughly test the capabilities of the Vaadin framework in developing a robust and user-friendly system. Leveraging Vaadin's server-centric architecture and extensive set of UI components, the digital memorial aims to provide an interactive and visually engaging platform for collective remembrance. By utilizing Vaadin's tools for automatic server-client communication and seamless data binding, this project serves as a practical exploration of how well Vaadin supports the implementation of a complex and emotionally significant application like a digital memorial.

This repository serves as a testing ground to assess Vaadin's suitability for building meaningful and responsive web applications. By sharing this project, I hope to contribute valuable insights into the framework's strengths and potential areas of improvement, offering developers a glimpse into the practical application of Vaadin in creating a collective digital space for remembrance and reflection.
